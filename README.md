# Traffic Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing traffic data to uncover patterns, identify peak traffic times, and predict future traffic volumes using various data science techniques including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, time series analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling.

## Key Features
 - Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, converted date/time formats, and removed duplicates and outliers.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized traffic patterns by time of day, day of the week, and month.
 - Time Series Analysis: Analyzed daily traffic trends and seasonal variations.
 - Clustering: Grouped similar traffic patterns using KMeans.
 - Predictive Modeling: Used Linear Regression to forecast traffic volumes.

## Results
 - Peak Traffic: Observed during morning and late afternoon.
 - Seasonal Trends: Identified higher traffic in certain months.
 - Day vs Night: Significant traffic during the day compared to night.
